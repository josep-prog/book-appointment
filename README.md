**Patient Side:**

As a patient shows up on the site, they will be presented with a list of Rwandan doctors available. The patient is given an opportunity to select any doctor he or she wishes to meet. Once they choose the doctor, they will visit a page where they will be required to enter their information such as name, sex, age, email and contact number. After that, they will be directed to the description page where they will be allowed to describe their health issue by writing or recording their voice. After this, they shoot the button of Submit Appointment. Upon the doctor confirming the appointment, the patient will get a email with all the details- the name of the doctor, the time of the appointment and the Google Meet link to use in the video call.

**Doctor Side:**

Each physician will log-in with their email and passwords to access his or her dashboard. They will be presented with two primary sections in the dashboard, namely, “App-Request” and “Appointment. The doctor can access new patient requests which are displayed under the App-Request with the details of the patient and the description of his health. In case the doctor would like to accept the appointment, it will be possible to select some free time slot. After being accepted, the appointment is transferred to the Appointment page, where the doctor will be able to initiate the meeting using the Google Meet link that is presented to them towards the designated patient.
